A Good allrounder laptop

This is the best all rounder laptop under 50K. I bought this for 45.5K (including 1500 card discount).If you are a student or working professional and your main usage depends upon productivity then you can go for it. (Not a gaming laptop!!!)Pros:1) Display - Very good for movie watching experience. Its not IPS as per specification but it looks like an IPS panel. You cant get any other laptop with an IPS panel display under 50k with I5/R5600 H series processor. you either get a I3 or R5500U which is less powerful than R5600H processor. Check for display properties in specs sheet and get an IPS panel instead of TN.2) Processor - Haven't checked with any heavy applications yet (try update later). As per internet, its a powerful processor equivalent to I5 H series processor. (between 40 to 60K you get processors with either U or H series mostly, where H series is more powerful than U series in terms of performance )3) 8GB ram & 512GB SSD - boot speed is around 5 to 7 seconds.4) Backlight keyboard with 3 levels of brightness which is better than single level of brightness as it irritates your eyes when using in pitch darkness5) Fingerprint sensor - Good placement of sensor and it is super fast, takes 1 to 2 seconds to unlock.6) Lifetime MS office accessCons :1) Speaker - I'm not sure whether I got a defective speaker, but the volume is too damn low. If the speaker volume is at 100% , Its like having 50% volume in your mobile phone. you definitely need an external speaker if you watch movies with group of people.2) Battery - I get 3hrs on browsing and movie watching at 70% brightness. As far as I checked all laptops except apple gives an average battery life.

It's overall good product. I would say ""value for money"". As i am currently using Linux on it , it runs pretty smoothly but have some problems like most prominent one is speakers and the build quality. Speakers are too low to be used for anything, so i increased the volume by another 100% through software and now it's somewhat usable.Students can go for it as it offers a big display which is very helpful while learning to code.just use it little carefully as it's not that well built.

The product feels premium. It have a large responsive Track pad. Display is brilliant. Keyboard is steady and keys are confidence inspiring. Very decent product for the price point. Haven't tested any games on it but for all other practical purposes it is a very good product
